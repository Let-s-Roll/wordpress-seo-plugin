# Search Console and Analytics Analysis

This document analyzes the search console data and Google Analytics to identify opportunities for improving the Let's Roll SEO Pages plugin.

## Key Findings

1.  **High demand for location-specific content:** The search query data shows a high volume of searches for skate spots, skate parks, and roller rinks in specific cities. This is the single biggest opportunity for growth.
2.  **Existing location pages are underperforming:** While our city and skatespot pages are getting traffic from search engines, they have an extremely high bounce rate and low average session duration. This indicates that users are not finding the information they're looking for on these pages.
3.  **Blog content is performing well:** Our blog posts have a much lower bounce rate and higher engagement, indicating that our content is resonating with users.
4.  **"Near me" searches are common:** Many users are searching for skating-related activities "near me," which suggests an opportunity for a location-aware feature.

## Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Enrich City Pages:**
    *   For each city, we should add comprehensive lists of:
        *   Skate spots
        *   Skate parks
        *   Roller rinks
        *   Local skate groups and clubs
    *   We should also include photos, descriptions, and user reviews for each location.
2.  **Expand City Coverage:**
    *   We need to create new city pages for all the locations that users are searching for. We can prioritize this based on the search volume from the `Queries.csv` data.
3.  **Create a "Near Me" Feature:**
    *   A "Near Me" button on the Explore page that uses the user's location to find nearby skate spots would be a powerful feature.
4.  **Develop More Engaging Content:**
    *   We should continue to create high-quality blog content that answers common user questions, such as "what is trail skating?" and "how to get started with aggressive quad skating."
5.  **Optimize for General Keywords:**
    *   We need to improve our rankings for broader terms like "roller skating" and "skating app." This can be achieved by creating more general-interest content and building more backlinks to the site.
