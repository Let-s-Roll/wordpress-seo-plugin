Following the successful implementation of the Let's Roll SEO Pages plugin and the achievement of indexing \~2,000 pages, this document outlines the strategic plan for the next phase of the project. The foundational goal of creating a significant web presence has been met. The primary objective now shifts from asset creation to asset monetization, specifically converting web traffic and visibility into measurable mobile app user growth and re-engagement.

## **2\. Primary Objective & KPIs**

**Primary Objective:** To leverage the network of \~2,000 SEO pages to drive a measurable increase in mobile app user acquisition and reactivate dormant users.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

* **Primary KPI:** Increase in weekly app downloads attributed to web referrals.  
* **Secondary KPIs:**  
  * Number of backlinks generated (from both in-app sharing and manual seeding).  
  * Click-through rate (CTR) of email reactivation campaigns.  
  * Reactivation rate of dormant users who engage with email campaigns.

## **3\. Strategic Workstreams**

The plan is organized into three core workstreams, designed to be executed in parallel and phased stages.

### **Workstream 1: Distribution & Backlink Generation**

* **Initiative 1.1: In-App Sharing Integration**

  * **Tasks:**  
    1. **Technical Scoping:** Define requirements and API needs with the mobile app development team.  
    2. **UI/UX Design:** Design and place "Share" buttons within the app's interface.  
    3. **Implementation:** Develop the link generation and native sharing functionality.  
    4. **Testing & Release:** Conduct end-to-end testing and release in the next app update.  
  * **Success Metric:** Number of unique shares generated from the app per week.  
* **Initiative 1.2: Manual Community Seeding**  
  * **Description:** Proactively share links to the SEO pages in relevant online communities to provide value, answer user questions, and build high-quality backlinks.  
  * **Tasks:**  
    1. **Identify Targets:** Compile a list of key Reddit subreddits, Facebook groups, and online forums for major cities.  
    2. **Monitor Conversations:** Actively look for discussions where our pages can provide a helpful answer.  
    3. **Engage Authentically:** Post helpful, non-spammy responses that include a link to a relevant SEO page.  
    4. **Track Results:** Monitor engagement and track acquired backlinks.  
  * **Success Metric:** Number of high-quality backlinks acquired per month.

### **Workstream 2: Content Scaling & Enrichment**

**Goal:** To expand the quantity of high-value content to attract a wider audience and capture more long-tail search traffic.

    2. **Scale Content Ingestion:** Continuously execute the process for converting web pages and PDFs into structured event data.  
    3. **Update & Deploy:** Regularly update the merged.json configuration and regenerate the sitemap.  
  * **Success Metric:** Total number of live, indexed event and city pages.

### **Workstream 3: User Conversion & Re-engagement**

**Goal:** To convert web traffic into new app users and reactivate dormant users from the existing mailing list.

  * **Tasks:**  
    1. **Segment Audience:** Segment the existing email list by user location, where possible.  
    2. **Develop Template:** Design an email template for a "Skate Scene Digest" or "Events in Your Area" newsletter.
