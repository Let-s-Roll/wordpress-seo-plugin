# Changelog

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-06

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Brevo Skater Location Sync:**
    *   Added a comprehensive new tool under "Settings -> Brevo Sync" to enrich Brevo contacts with city data based on their activity in the Let's Roll app.
    *   **Dry-Run & Testing:** The tool allows you to load a list of skaters for any city without making changes, and then test the enrichment process on a single skater to ensure the connection is working.
    *   **Single-City & Full Sync:** You can run the sync process for just one selected city or for all cities at once.
    *   **Duplicate Prevention:** The tool now keeps a log of all skaters that have been successfully processed. It will automatically skip these skaters in future runs to prevent redundant API calls.
    *   **Log Management:** A "Processed Skaters Log" is now visible on the admin page. You can view which city each skater was synced to, remove individual skaters from the log to re-sync them, or clear the entire log for a full reset.
    *   **IP Whitelisting Helper:** The admin page now displays the server's public IP address to make it easy to whitelist in the Brevo API settings.
    *   **Geographically Accurate Filtering:** The skater fetching logic has been significantly improved. It now uses the distance data from the API's `activities` object to ensure that only skaters genuinely within a city's defined radius are included, making the sync data much more accurate.

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-06

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   **Fixed CTA Banner on Explore Page:** Resolved an issue where the Call-to-Action banner on the `/explore` page was duplicated, incorrectly positioned at the top of the page, and had a non-functional close button. The banner now renders correctly in the footer and is fully functional, matching the behavior on all other pages.
*   **Corrected Mobile Button Sizes:** Fixed a visual bug in the CTA banner where the Apple App Store and Google Play Store buttons were rendered at different sizes on mobile devices. Both buttons now have a consistent height and alignment.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-06

###  housekeeping

*   **AI Developer Guide Updated:** Refined the `GEMINI.md` instructions to be more direct and professional. Removed the "Rollie" persona and added a clear system mandate defining the AI's role and the project's context.

### ‚ú® SEO & Engagement Improvements

*   **Richer City Pages:** Increased the number of items displayed on city pages from 3 to 6 for skate spots, local skaters, and upcoming events. This provides a more comprehensive overview of the local scene for visitors, addressing the high bounce rate identified in analytics.
*   **Improved "Near You" Accuracy:** Standardized the city radii in `country_data/merged.json` using a tiered system based on city size (Mega-Hub, Major, Standard, Compact). This improves the consistency and accuracy of the IP-based city matching for the "Near You" feature on the Explore page.
*   **Geolocation Debugging:** Added temporary logging to the Explore page to provide visibility into the IP geolocation and city-matching process, allowing for easier debugging and refinement of the "Near You" feature.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   **Corrected Indianapolis City Data:** Fixed a data entry error in `country_data/merged.json` where the city of Indianapolis was missing its name and coordinates, causing it to appear as an empty list item on the United States country page.
*   **Removed Debug Logging:** Removed temporary `error_log` statements from the Explore page template that were used for debugging the geolocation feature.

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-04

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **CTA Banner on Explore Page:** Added the app download CTA banner to the main Explore page to improve user conversion.
*   **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Added breadcrumb navigation to the Explore, Country, City, and Detail pages to improve user experience and SEO. The breadcrumbs are fully AMP-compatible.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   **CTA Banner Formatting:** Corrected the implementation of the CTA banner on the Explore page to ensure it renders at full-width by hooking into the `wp_footer` action, consistent with other page templates.

###  housekeeping

*   **AI Developer Guide Updated:** Updated the `GEMINI.md` file with new core rules for the AI assistant, including a mandate for AMP compatibility and a focus on SEO. Removed the outdated "City Page as Blueprint" rule.
*   **Improved CTA Banner Documentation:** Added comprehensive file and function-level docblocks to `cta-banner.php` to improve code clarity and maintainability.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-04

This major update introduces a dynamic "Near You" section to the Explore page and significantly hardens the plugin's API interactions for production environments.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Dynamic "Near You" Section on Explore Page:**
    *   The Explore page now features a "Rollerskating Near You" section that is displayed at the top of the page.
    *   This section is powered by IP-based geolocation to determine the user's approximate location.
    *   A city-matching algorithm compares the user's location against the curated list of cities in `country_data/merged.json`. The "Near You" section is **only displayed** if the user is within the defined radius of a known city, ensuring a high-quality, relevant experience.
    *   When a city is matched, the section uses that city's specific coordinates and radius to display the most popular local skate spots, upcoming events, and nearby skaters.
    *   "View All" links are provided for each section, directing users to the full city-specific pages.
    *   The entire section is hidden from known search engine bots to provide a clean, static page for indexing.

*   **"Featured Cities" Section:**
    *   A new "Featured Cities" section has been added to the Explore page, showcasing prominent skating locations like Paris, New York, Tokyo, and Los Angeles.

### üöÄ Performance & Reliability

*   **24-Hour API Caching:**
    *   All API calls (for spots, events, skaters, and IP geolocation) are now cached for 24 hours using the WordPress Transients API. This dramatically improves performance for repeat visitors and reduces server load.
    *   A cache-busting version number (`LR_CACHE_VERSION`) has been implemented, allowing all caches to be invalidated easily by incrementing the version.
    *   Caching is automatically bypassed when the plugin's "Testing Mode" is enabled.

*   **Self-Healing Authentication:**
    *   The core API fetching function now includes robust retry logic. If an API call fails with a `401 Unauthorized` error (due to an expired token), the system automatically deletes the old token, requests a fresh one, and retries the original API call.
    *   Fixed a critical bug where the "Bearer " prefix was being duplicated in the authentication token, causing all API calls to fail.
    *   Error handling for authentication has been significantly improved to provide clear, actionable error messages.

*   **Robust IP Address Detection:**
    *   The plugin now uses a hardened function to detect the user's real IP address, correctly handling requests that come through reverse proxies or load balancers (like Cloudflare) by checking common server headers (`HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP`, `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`, etc.).

*   **Standalone Image Proxy:**
    *   The `image-proxy.php` script has been rewritten to be fully self-contained. It now correctly loads the WordPress environment and its own functions to handle authentication and API calls, resolving numerous `502 Bad Gateway` errors that occurred in certain environments.
    *   Corrected the API endpoints used by the proxy for fetching spot and event images, fixing `404 Not Found` errors.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a persistent bug where event images were not loading on the Explore page by ensuring the code performs a secondary API call to fetch attachment details, mirroring the logic of the working City page.
*   Resolved numerous fatal errors caused by incorrect function calls and dependency loading issues.

###  housekeeping

*   Added a `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive environment files (`.env`) and temporary files from being committed to the repository.
