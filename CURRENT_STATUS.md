# Project Status: Content Automation Feature

This document outlines the current status of the Content Automation feature development.

## Overall Status: Complete & Stable

The Content Automation feature is **feature-complete, stable, and ready for handover.** All core architectural goals have been met, and all known bugs have been resolved.

The system successfully implements the full three-layer architecture for discovering, publishing, and distributing local content.

## Final Architecture & Features

*   **Layer 1: Discovery (Complete):** A daily background job correctly discovers new spots, events, reviews, sessions, and skaters for each city and saves the raw, enriched data to the `wp_lr_discovered_content` database table.

*   **Layer 2: AI-Powered Publication (Complete):**
    *   **AI as "Content Glue":** The system uses a Gemini AI to generate engaging, SEO-friendly "content glue" (titles, summaries, and section intros) that wraps around the visually rich, template-driven content cards. This creates a professional, blog-style post rather than a simple data dump.
    *   **Robust Fallback System:** If the AI call fails for any reason (e.g., invalid API key, API downtime), the system automatically and gracefully falls back to a template-only rendering mode. This ensures that an update is **always** posted, guaranteeing reliability.
    *   **Flexible Frequency:** A global setting allows for switching content generation between **Weekly** and **Monthly** buckets. This provides the flexibility to handle both high-activity and low-activity cities effectively.
    *   **Historical Seeding:** The "Seed Historical Posts" feature correctly backfills content for the last 6 months, respecting the selected weekly or monthly frequency.

*   **Visual & UX Polish (Complete):**
    *   All content (Spots, Events, Skaters, Reviews, Sessions) is rendered using a consistent, "boxed-in" card format across all update pages.
    *   The `/updates/` archive page has been enhanced with a blog-style layout, featuring a post title, a short AI-generated summary, and a featured image for each update.
    *   The system correctly uses historical dates for seeded posts.
    *   A robust, AMP-compliant, server-side fallback for skater avatars has been implemented using the image proxy, ensuring a professional appearance even when users do not have a profile photo.

## Next Steps & Future Enhancements

The current system is stable and provides a high degree of control. The most logical next step would be to evolve the flexible frequency setting into a fully autonomous "Smart" system.

*   **Proposed "Smart" System:** A daily cron job would analyze the volume of unpublished content for each city. Based on configurable thresholds (e.g., "more than 15 new items"), it would automatically decide whether to generate a weekly post for a high-activity city or wait and consolidate content into a monthly post for a low-activity city. This would make the system fully "set it and forget it."
