# Project Status: Content Automation Feature

This document outlines the current status of the Content Automation feature development.

## Overall Process & Architecture

The goal is to build a three-layer system for automatically discovering, publishing, and distributing local content.

*   **Layer 1: Discovery:** A daily background job scans the Let's Roll API for new content (spots, events, reviews, sessions, skaters) for each city and saves this raw data into a custom database table (`wp_lr_discovered_content`).
*   **Layer 2: Publication:** A second background job aggregates the newly discovered content from the database and generates public-facing "City Update" posts, which are stored in a separate custom table (`wp_lr_city_updates`).
*   **Layer 3: Distribution:** (Future) An email system will use the content from the published posts to send newsletters.

We have also built a comprehensive admin panel for monitoring and manually triggering these processes for testing.

## Current Status: Almost Complete

The project is in the final stages of completing the non-AI version of this pipeline.

*   **Layer 1 (Discovery):** **Complete and Functional.** The system correctly discovers all five content types and saves them to the database. All data-fetching logic has been consolidated and verified for accuracy and efficiency.
*   **Admin Panel:** **Complete and Functional.** The UI for monitoring the database, viewing logs, and triggering both full and single-city discovery runs is working.
*   **Layer 2 (Publication):** **Mostly Complete.**
    *   The system can successfully generate daily "City Update" posts.
    *   The system includes a "Seeding" feature to back-fill historical content by creating weekly posts from the initial data import.
    *   All rendering logic has been consolidated into reusable functions to ensure visual consistency between the SEO pages and the new update posts.

## The Single Remaining Problem

There is one specific, reproducible bug remaining:

**When using the "Seed Historical Posts" feature, the generated weekly posts do not contain any "Latest Sessions" sections.**

*   The log files confirm that session data **is being successfully discovered** and saved to the database in Layer 1.
*   The log files confirm that the seeding function **is finding** the session data in the database.
*   The final, generated weekly posts correctly contain sections for new spots, events, reviews, and skaters.
*   However, the "Latest Sessions" section is completely missing from the output, despite the data being present and the rendering logic for other content types working correctly.
