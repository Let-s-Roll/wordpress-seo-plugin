Over at the Angel City Derby warehouse, the vibes were immaculate with a packed schedule including their [Spooktacular Roller Disco](https://www.angelcityderby.com/events) and a thrilling [Halloween Double Header](https://www.angelcityderby.com/events). With so much organized fun, it's no wonder our app was a little quiet on new discoveries—everyone was busy participating! As we roll into November, let's keep that momentum going. Let's take the energy from these huge meetups and use it to explore new corners of our city and share them with the community.
